# Exploring the Impact of Different Language Models in a Siamese Network Structure for Information Retrieval

See [notebook](SBERT.ipynb), where the code has been collected. Otherwise, the code is defined as commands in the:
- [prepare_data.py](prepare_data.py)
- [main.py](main.py)

This project is formed by:

- Carl Schmidt (s204154)
- Joachim Schr√∏der (s204096)
- Julius Radzikowski (s204162)
- Jonas Hoffman (s204076)

The supervisor of the project is:

- Beatrix

The project will involve the BERT model, and use a dataset found from https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/TREC-Deep-Learning-2019.
